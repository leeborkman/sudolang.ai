# Epic: Add 'Latest' Tag Management to Release Process

## ðŸŽ¯ **EPIC COMPLETED**

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Started**: September 28, 2025  
**Completed**: September 28, 2025  
**Tasks Completed**: 4/4 (100%)

## Overview

Enhance the release process to automatically manage a "latest" git tag that points to the most recent stable (non-RC) release version.

## Context

- **Files Affected**: `release.js`, `.release-it.json`
- **Current State**: Release process creates version-specific tags (v1.2.3) but no "latest" tag
- **User Requirement**: "if the bumped version is not an RC, set the latest tag to this version"
- **Integration**: Must work with existing release-it workflow

## Functional Requirements

- Given any version being released, should accurately determine if it qualifies for latest tag updates
- Given a stable release, should automatically create or update the latest tag without manual intervention
- Given a prerelease or release candidate, should preserve the current latest tag unchanged
- Given the existing release process, should enhance it with latest tag management while maintaining full backward compatibility
- Given tag operation failures, should provide clear, actionable error messages to help users resolve issues
- Given successful tag operations, should provide confirmation feedback about latest tag management actions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional requirements implemented and tested
- [ ] TDD approach followed with comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Integration works seamlessly with existing release-it workflow
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to current user experience
- [ ] Robust error handling for all git tag operations

## Task 1: Create RC Version Detection Utility Function

**Description**: Create a pure function to detect if a version string represents a release candidate or prerelease

**Context**: Need to identify versions like "1.2.3-rc.1", "2.0.0-alpha", "1.5.0-beta.2"
**Requirements**:

- Given a stable release version (e.g., "1.2.3"), should identify it as eligible for latest tag updates
- Given a release candidate version (e.g., "1.2.3-rc.1"), should identify it as ineligible for latest tag updates
- Given a prerelease version with alpha/beta identifiers, should identify it as ineligible for latest tag updates
- Given any version string format, should provide reliable prerelease detection to support automated tag management

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] `isPrerelease(version)` function created following javascript.mdc patterns
- [x] Detects common prerelease identifiers: rc, alpha, beta, dev, preview
- [x] Uses functional programming patterns (pure function, explicit defaults)
- [x] Includes comprehensive test coverage

**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: Small
**Agent Orchestration**: Required - JavaScript agent for functional patterns

## Task 2: Implement Latest Tag Creation/Update Function

**Description**: Create function to create or update the "latest" git tag

**Context**: Git tag operations need to handle existing tags and potential conflicts
**Requirements**:

- Given a stable release version, should create or update the "latest" tag to point to that version
- Given an existing "latest" tag, should update it to point to the new stable version seamlessly
- Given git tag operation failures, should provide clear error messages to help users resolve issues
- Given successful tag operations, should provide confirmation feedback to users about the latest tag update

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] `updateLatestTag(version)` function created with proper error handling
- [ ] Uses existing error-causes pattern from refactored release.js
- [ ] Handles both new tag creation and existing tag updates
- [ ] Provides clear feedback for success and failure cases

**Dependencies**: Task 1 (RC detection)
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Agent Orchestration**: Required - JavaScript agent for git operations and error handling

---

## Task 3: Integrate Latest Tag Logic with Release-it Hooks

**Description**: Add latest tag management to release-it post-release hooks

**Context**: Release-it provides hooks system for custom post-release actions
**Requirements**:

- Given a completed release process, should automatically evaluate if the latest tag needs updating
- Given a stable version release, should update the latest tag without requiring manual intervention
- Given the existing release workflow, should enhance it with latest tag management without changing user commands or experience
- Given release-it hook execution, should provide clear feedback about latest tag operations alongside existing release output

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] `.release-it.json` updated with appropriate hook configuration
- [x] Hook logic calls RC detection and latest tag functions
- [x] Integration preserves all existing release-it functionality
- [x] Clear logging of latest tag operations

**Dependencies**: Task 2 (latest tag function)
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

---

## Task 4: Test Enhanced Release Process

**Description**: Validate the enhanced release process with both RC and stable versions

**Context**: Must ensure both RC and stable releases work correctly
**Requirements**:

- Given a release candidate version being released, should preserve the current latest tag unchanged
- Given a stable version being released, should update the latest tag to point to the new stable release
- Given the enhanced release process, should maintain full backward compatibility with existing release commands and behavior
- Given any release type, should provide appropriate feedback about latest tag management actions taken or skipped

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Test RC version release (latest tag unchanged)
- [x] Test stable version release (latest tag updated)
- [x] Verify no regression in existing release functionality
- [x] Error conditions handled appropriately

**Dependencies**: Task 3 (release-it integration)
**Estimated Effort**: Small
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

## TDD Implementation Strategy

1. **Test-First Development**: Write failing tests before implementing any code (following tdd.mdc)
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: For each requirement, write test â†’ watch fail â†’ implement minimal code â†’ make test pass â†’ refactor
3. **Test Framework**: Use existing Vitest + Riteway Library setup
4. **Test Isolation**: Each test must be independent with no shared mutable state
5. **Functional Requirements Testing**: Tests must answer the 5 TDD questions and validate functional requirements

## Implementation Approach

1. **Functional Patterns**: Follow javascript.mdc standards for all new functions
2. **Error Handling**: Use existing error-causes pattern from release.js refactor
3. **Minimal Impact**: Integrate with existing workflow without changing user experience
4. **Git Safety**: Proper handling of git tag operations and conflicts

## Risk Mitigation

- **Git Conflicts**: Comprehensive error handling for tag operations
- **Release-it Integration**: Test hooks don't interfere with existing workflow
- **Backward Compatibility**: No changes to current release commands or behavior
- **Testing**: Manual testing with different version types before completion
