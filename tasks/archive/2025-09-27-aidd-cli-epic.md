# AIDD CLI Epic - AI Driven Development

**Epic Goal**: Create a globally installable CLI tool called `aidd` (AI Driven Development) that clones the AI agent orchestration system to any directory

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Completed**: 2025-09-27
**Estimated Effort**: Large

## Epic Overview

Add a Node.js CLI to the existing `sudolang.ai` package that developers can install globally via npm to scaffold the SudoLang AI agent orchestration system into their projects. The tool should follow Unix CLI conventions and JavaScript best practices.

**Context**: The `/ai/` folder in this repository contains a comprehensive agent orchestration system with commands and rules that enable AI Driven Development workflows. This CLI will be integrated into the existing package to make it easy for developers to adopt this system by cloning the ai/ folder to their projects.

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Globally installable via `npm install -g aidd` with `aidd` command
- [x] Successfully clones ai/ folder structure from installed package to target directory
- [x] Follows Unix CLI conventions (--help, --version, etc.)
- [x] Handles errors gracefully with clear user feedback
- [x] Includes comprehensive tests following TDD
- [x] Complete documentation and usage examples

---

## Task 1: Setup CLI Integration in Existing Package

**Context**: Add CLI functionality to the existing sudolang.ai package with proper bin configuration for global installation

**Requirements**:

- Given existing package.json, should add bin field pointing to aidd CLI
- Given package installation, should make `aidd` command globally available
- Given CLI structure, should follow Node.js CLI best practices within existing project

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] package.json updated with bin field: `"aidd": "./bin/aidd.js"`
- [x] CLI directory structure created (bin/, lib/ folders)
- [x] CLI entry point created with proper shebang for Unix systems
- [x] Package can be installed locally for testing with `npm link`
- [x] CLI can locate bundled ai/ folder relative to package installation

**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: Small
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang in bin/aidd.js
- CLI should find ai/ folder using path.resolve(\_\_dirname, '../ai')
- Add CLI-related dependencies to existing package.json
- Add files field to package.json to ensure ai/ folder is included in published package

---

## Task 2: Implement CLI Interface with Argument Parsing

**Context**: Implement the core CLI interface following Unix conventions with proper argument parsing

**Requirements**:

- Given CLI invocation with no args, should clone to current directory
- Given CLI invocation with target path, should clone to specified directory
- Given --help flag, should display usage information
- Given --version flag, should display version number
- Given --force flag, should overwrite existing files
- Given --dry-run flag, should show what would be copied without copying
- Given --verbose flag, should provide detailed output

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Properly parses command line arguments using a robust library
- [x] Implements all required flags following Unix conventions
- [x] Provides clear help text with examples
- [x] Validates arguments and provides helpful error messages
- [x] Handles edge cases (invalid paths, missing permissions, etc.)

**Dependencies**: Task 1 (CLI Integration)
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use commander.js or yargs for argument parsing
- Follow JavaScript guide for functional programming approach
- Validate paths and permissions before attempting operations

---

## Task 3: Implement AI Folder Cloning Logic

**Context**: Core functionality to copy the bundled ai/ folder structure to target directory

**Requirements**:

- Given bundled ai/ folder from package installation, should recursively copy all files and directories
- Given target directory, should create ai/ subdirectory within it
- Given existing files with --force, should overwrite them
- Given existing files without --force, should prompt or error appropriately
- Given --dry-run mode, should list files that would be copied

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Locates ai/ folder bundled within installed package using relative path
- [x] Recursively copies entire ai/ folder structure to target location
- [x] Preserves file permissions and directory structure
- [x] Creates target directory if it doesn't exist
- [x] Handles file conflicts appropriately based on flags
- [x] Provides progress feedback during copy operations

**Dependencies**: Task 2 (CLI Interface)
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

**Implementation Notes**:

- Find source ai/ folder: `path.resolve(__dirname, '../ai')`
- Use Node.js fs/promises for async file operations
- Consider using fs-extra for enhanced file operations
- Implement proper error handling for file system operations
- Follow functional programming patterns from JavaScript guide

---

## Task 4: Add Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback

**Context**: Enhance CLI with robust error handling and clear user communication

**Requirements**:

- Given file system errors, should provide clear, actionable error messages
- Given permission issues, should suggest solutions
- Given invalid arguments, should show usage help
- Given successful operations, should provide confirmation feedback
- Given --verbose mode, should show detailed operation progress

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes
- [x] Clear, user-friendly error messages
- [x] Appropriate exit codes for different error conditions
- [x] Progress indicators for long-running operations
- [x] Consistent formatting and messaging style

**Dependencies**: Task 3 (Cloning Logic)
**Estimated Effort**: Small
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use consistent error message formatting
- Provide helpful suggestions for common issues
- Follow Unix conventions for exit codes
- Consider using chalk for colored output

---

## Task 5: Create Tests Following TDD Principles

**Context**: Implement comprehensive test suite following TDD methodology
