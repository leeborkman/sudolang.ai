# Log Guide Epic - Dramatically Improved Logging with Epic-Focus

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (2025-09-27)  
**Goal**: Transform activity logging from granular technical details to epic-focused accomplishments

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Epic-Focused Logging**: Only log completed epics, not config changes or file moves
2. **Clear Guidelines**: Added comprehensive DO NOT LOG list to prevent clutter
3. **Brief Descriptions**: Enforced < 50 character constraint for scannable entries
4. **Clean Activity Log**: Reduced from 58 lines of technical details to 20 lines of major accomplishments

## Files Modified

- `ai/rules/log.mdc` - Updated logging guidelines with epic-focused approach
- `activity-log.md` - Cleaned up existing entries to match new epic-focused format

## Impact

Activity log now tells the story of major accomplishments instead of implementation details, making it actually useful for understanding project progress.
