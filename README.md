# SudoLang.ai

**The standard library for AI Driven Development.**

A public collection of reusable metaprograms, agent scripts, and prompt modules.

**SudoLang** is a pseudocode language for prompting large language models with clear structure, strong typing, and explicit control flow.

## Why SudoLang?

For most simple prompts, natural language is better. Use it. But if you need the AI to follow a program, obey constraints, keep track of complex state, or implement complex algorithms, SudoLang can be extremely useful.

- Because of the natural language emphasis, SudoLang is easier to learn than programming languages like JavaScript or Python.
- Pseudocode can [improve reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11790) vs natural language prompts, and create shorthands for many prompting styles, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, decision trees, etc.
- SudoLang is a declarative, constraint-based, interface-oriented programming language, which makes it one of the most expressive and compact programming languages in the world. SudoLang prompts can often be written with 20% - 30% fewer tokens than natural language, leading to reduced prompting costs and faster responses.
- Structured pseudocode provides scope blocks, indentation, and visual encapsulation which makes it easier to navigate and maintain complex prompts than natural language.
- Structured templates and queries using predefined types and interfaces can reduce the probability of malformed responses and [dramatically reduce the number of tokens required](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06094.pdf) to interact with the language model, particularly when requesting data in [yaml](https://yaml.org/) or [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) formats.
