# Master AI Driven Development with 1:1 Mentorship from Eric Elliott

Learn proven AI-driven development workflows from the developer who helped define them. Transform from "vibe coding" to systematic, production-quality software development.

## Vibe Coding is Fragile

Most developers are struggling with AI tools. Fix one thing and something else breaks. Coding with AI turns into a game of whack-a-mole. You're different. You want to master AI Driven Development so you can build production-quality software on autopilot. Right now you're probably skeptical of claims that AI can substantially increase your productivity. Sometimes it feels like it slows you down more than it helps.

**The truth?** It's possible to gain 3x - 10x productivity using AI. The missing link is a systematic approach to AI Driven Development - the same kinds of quality practices that have always made human developers more productive.

Instead of trial-and-error, learn proven frameworks from someone who's been developing them since before AIDD was mainstream.

## About Eric Elliott

Eric Elliott is an early pioneer of AI Driven Development, helping define the systematic approaches that separate productive AIDD from chaotic tool-switching. Since early 2023, he's guided developers through the transition from traditional development to AI-first workflows, and helped improve over-all productivity 5x - 10x+ on several different teams. He's the creator of SudoLang, a language designed specifically for AI Driven Development, and author of the book "The Art of Effortless Programming: Unleashing the Power of AI Driven Development".

**Learn proven AI-driven development workflows from the developer who helped define them.**

This isn't about learning the latest AI tools (these change fast). This is about learning the fundamental problem-solving frameworks that work with any AI coding technology—ensuring your skills remain valuable as the landscape evolves.

## Master Systematic Processes

Stop guessing. Learn to structure problems so AI delivers exactly what you need. Master the systematic processes and quality engineering approaches that produce results comparable to the best senior human developers. The keys are context management and agent loops that incorporate the same best practice tools and techniques that humans have used for decades. 

## Become an AIDD Expert

Position yourself as the AI development expert your organization needs. Learn to build 3x-10x faster while maintaining production quality. Lead AI adoption instead of following it.

## Limited Availability

**This is live mentorship with Eric Elliott. Only a few slots available - act fast.**

Eric personally mentors only a few developers per year to ensure each person gets the attention needed for true transformation.

## Why Now?

While other developers struggle with AI adoption, you'll be leading it. The gap between AI-savvy developers and everyone else is growing quickly. Position yourself on the right side of this divide.

## From Vibe Coding to Production Quality

**Here's what most developers miss:** AI tools are powerful, but they're only as good as the problems you give them. 

"Vibe coding" with AI — throwing prompts at ChatGPT and hoping for the best — might work for quick scripts, demos, and one-off prototypes. But production software requires systematic thinking:

- **Problem decomposition:** Breaking complex requirements into AI-solvable components
- **Quality engineering:** Test Driven Development (TDD) on autopilot
- **Architecture decisions:** Designing systems that leverage AI capabilities
- **Code review processes:** Ensuring AI-generated code meets production standards

Good systems and habits are the keys that separate average and 10x developers. And it's exactly what you'll master through this mentorship.

## FAQ

> *"What if AI changes?"*

That's exactly why this program focuses on principles, not tools. The specific AI models will change. The systematic thinking approaches will remain valuable forever.

> *"Can I learn this on my own?"*

You could spend years figuring out what works through trial and error. Or you can learn proven frameworks from someone who's already done the work. Your choice: years of struggle, or months of guided growth.

> *"Am I experienced enough?"*

It's easier to learn the right approaches from the start than to unlearn bad habits later. Eric meets you where you are, puts you on the fast-track to success, and builds from there.
