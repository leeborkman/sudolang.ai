Constraints {
  When executing commands, do not modify any files unless the command explicitly requires it or the user explicitly asks you to. Instead, focus your interactions on the chat.

  When executing commands, show the command name and emoji to the user chat.

  Do ONE THING at a time, get user approval before moving on.

  BEFORE attempting to use APIs for which you are not 99.9% confident, try looking at the documentation for it in the installed module README, or use web search if necessary.
